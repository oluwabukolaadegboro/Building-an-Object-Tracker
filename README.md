# Building-an-Object-Tracker

This consitutes a part of my computer vision coursework taught by Georgia Gkioxari (a research scientist at Facebook) during my African Masters in Machine Intelligence (AMMI) program at AIMS Rwanda. 

This project involves building a simple object tracker in real-time that detects objects on all video frames using predictions from a d2 model, and links these predictions across time frames.

Part A involves detecting objects in a frame, Part B involves tracking objects in pairs of frames and finally Part C involves tracking objects in videos.
