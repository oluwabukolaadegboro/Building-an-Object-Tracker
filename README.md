# Building-an-Object-Tracker

This consitutes a part of my computer vision coursework taught by Georgia Gkioxari (a research scientist at Facebook) during my African Masters in Machine Intelligence (AMMI) program at AIMS Rwanda. 

This project involves building a simple object tracker in real-time that detects objects on all video frames using predictions from a d2 model, and links these predictions across time frames. The <a href='https://github.com/gkioxari/aims2020_visualrecognition/releases/download/v1.0/videoclip.zip'> dataset </a> consists of a video clip with 41 frames. 

The implementation of this project took place in three parts: 
1. In task 1, my tracker system could detect objects in a frame.
2. In task 2, I could track objects in pairs of frames.
3. Finally in task 3, I could track objects in videos.
